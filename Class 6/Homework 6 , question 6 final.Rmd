Question 6 walkthrough:

Q6. How would you generalize the original code above to work with any set of input
protein structures?

```{r}
library(bio3d)

# put any PDB IDs or file names here- in this case- I wanted to condense the repetitive lines of code  for s1,s2,s3
pdb_ids <- c("4AKE", "1AKE", "1E4Y")

# read, trim, and extract B-factors automatically, similified less repetive version
pdb_list <- lapply(pdb_ids, read.pdb)
chain_list <- lapply(pdb_list, function(x) trim.pdb(x, chain = "A", elety = "CA"))
bfactors <- lapply(chain_list, function(x) x$atom$b)

# common y-range for consistent scale
yl <- range(unlist(bfactors), na.rm = TRUE)

# plot each protein separately, same as before
for (i in seq_along(pdb_ids)) {
  plotb3(bfactors[[i]], 
         sse = chain_list[[i]], 
         typ = "l", 
         ylab = "B-factor", 
         ylim = yl, 
         main = pdb_ids[i])
}

```
Comments:

Plots of all the proteins

plotb3() is a B-factor plot that shows how flexible each residue (or atom, if you plot all atoms) is within a protein structure.These B-factor plots show how atomic flexibility varies along the protein chain.
Comparing several proteins lets you see which regions become more rigid or flexible between structures
